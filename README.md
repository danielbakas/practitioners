## Solid Practitioners

-- a hub for those putting the Solid vision into practice

### Goal

The goal of `Solid Practitioners` is to support a diverse range of people and organizations using Solid in real world projects. 

### Announcements

This is a work in progress, your feedback is important, please join the [discussion on this README](https://github.com/solid-contrib/practitioners/discussions/1), the [discussion on roles and functions](https://github.com/solid-contrib/practitioners/discussions/2) or the [Matrix #solid-practitioners chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#solid-practitioners:matrix.org).

The first online meetup of `Solid Practitioners` will be held on Friday, 10 November at 14:00 UTC at https://meet.jit.si/solid-practitioners.

Please email me (dubzed@gmail.com) to be included in infrequent emails related to the group and event invites.

### Scope

In addition to technical issues, the group's discussion may also include the social impact of Solid projects and issues related to the adoption of Solid by public agencies and other organizations.  The focus will be on "getting things done with what exists" rather than on specification-related issues which will be referred to the [W3C Solid Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/). Another focus will be on networking between projects - for example collarborating on the development of ontologies or a common codebase.  Onboarding new developers will be left to the [onboarding team](https://github.com/solid-contrib/getting-started) although internships with existing practitioners can provide a pathway for new developers as well.

### Audience

This could be broad - e.g. anyone building anything with Solid or anything user-oriented with Solid.

Or narrow - only projects creating social benefit with Solid.

Or something in between - apps but not servers or libraries? non-commercial uses only? other criteria?

If it's all user-oriented apps it includes things like SolidOS, Syntropize, recipe and movie apps, chat and social media apps.
